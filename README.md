Intentions:



* This program seeks to help all incoming students during the transition to the college environment. Transitioning to college is a big challenge for freshmen every year. 
  * Sometimes just having a mentor to guide them through the first few months can make all the difference in making them feel comfortable in their new environment. 
* The goal of this program is to pair incoming freshmen with volunteer upperclassmen who will act as guides for first year students.
  * Incoming first year students will answer a series of personality questions, beginning with broad questions and narrowing down to specific interests and passions that they hope to explore during their time at Pitt. 
  * The database will allow the student to choose traits and qualities that they hope to find in a mentor, such as their academic school, class schedule, and extracurricular interests. 
  * The database will use these responses to find a sufficient personality match and initiate communication between the students and their mentors.

* We also decided that instead of overwhelming mentors with numerous mentees, we would instead limit each mentor to a maximum of 3 mentees. This allows mentors to focus in on a few students instead of dividing their attention between many mentees. 

* We decided
